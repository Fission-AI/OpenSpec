  Spec compliance:
  - Before explore, creating or updating any artifact, or implementing/modifying code,
    run `openspec list --specs --json` to discover existing specs and their summaries.
    Identify relevant specs from the summaries, then read each in
    openspec/specs/<name>/*.md.
  - Ensure changes don't contradict existing requirements.
  - Code must conform to all applicable spec requirements.
  - If a spec is unclear, incomplete, or potentially conflicts with the
    implementation, stop and inform the user. The user decides whether to
    proceed as-is or explore an alternative approach.
  - If a decision changes an existing spec's assumptions, note it explicitly.
  - If new specs dependencies are discovered, update the relevant artifacts
    (design.md, proposal.md, tasks.md, etc.) to reflect them before continuing.

  Cross-platform requirements:
  - This tool runs on macOS, Linux, AND Windows
  - Always use path.join() or path.resolve() for file paths - never hardcode slashes
  - Never assume forward-slash path separators
  - Tests must use path.join() for expected path values, not hardcoded strings
  - Consider case sensitivity differences in file systems

rules:
  specs:
    - Include scenarios for Windows path handling when dealing with file paths
    - Requirements involving paths must specify cross-platform behavior
  tasks:
    - Add Windows CI verification as a task when changes involve file paths
    - Include cross-platform testing considerations
  design:
    - Document any platform-specific behavior or limitations
    - Prefer Node.js path module over string manipulation for paths
