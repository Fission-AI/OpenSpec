# cli-artifact-workflow Specification Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Status Command

The system SHALL display artifact completion status for a change, including scaffolded (empty) changes.

> **Fixes bug**: Previously required `proposal.md` to exist via `getActiveChangeIds()`.

#### Scenario: Show status with all states

- **WHEN** user runs `openspec status --change <id>`
- **THEN** the system displays each artifact with status indicator:
  - `[x]` for completed artifacts
  - `[ ]` for ready artifacts
  - `[-]` for blocked artifacts (with missing dependencies listed)

#### Scenario: Status shows completion summary

- **WHEN** user runs `openspec status --change <id>`
- **THEN** output includes completion percentage and count (e.g., "2/4 artifacts complete")

#### Scenario: Status JSON output

- **WHEN** user runs `openspec status --change <id> --json`
- **THEN** the system outputs JSON with changeName, schemaName, isComplete, and artifacts array

#### Scenario: Status on scaffolded change

- **WHEN** user runs `openspec status --change <id>` on a change with no artifacts
- **THEN** system displays all artifacts with their status
- **AND** root artifacts (no dependencies) show as ready `[ ]`
- **AND** dependent artifacts show as blocked `[-]`

#### Scenario: Missing change parameter

- **WHEN** user runs `openspec status` without `--change`
- **THEN** the system displays an error with list of available changes
- **AND** includes scaffolded changes (directories without proposal.md)

#### Scenario: Unknown change

- **WHEN** user runs `openspec status --change unknown-id`
- **AND** directory `openspec/changes/unknown-id/` does not exist
- **THEN** the system displays an error listing all available change directories

### Requirement: Next Command

The system SHALL show which artifacts are ready to be created, including for scaffolded changes.

#### Scenario: Show ready artifacts

- **WHEN** user runs `openspec next --change <id>`
- **THEN** the system lists artifacts whose dependencies are all satisfied

#### Scenario: No artifacts ready

- **WHEN** all artifacts are either completed or blocked
- **THEN** the system indicates no artifacts are ready (with explanation)

#### Scenario: All artifacts complete

- **WHEN** all artifacts in the change are completed
- **THEN** the system indicates the change is complete

#### Scenario: Next JSON output

- **WHEN** user runs `openspec next --change <id> --json`
- **THEN** the system outputs JSON array of ready artifact IDs

#### Scenario: Next on scaffolded change

- **WHEN** user runs `openspec next --change <id>` on a change with no artifacts
- **THEN** system shows root artifacts (e.g., "proposal") as ready to create

### Requirement: Instructions Command

The system SHALL output enriched instructions for creating an artifact, including for scaffolded changes.

#### Scenario: Show enriched instructions

- **WHEN** user runs `openspec instructions <artifact> --change <id>`
- **THEN** the system outputs:
  - Artifact metadata (ID, output path, description)
  - Template content
  - Dependency status (done/missing)
  - Unlocked artifacts (what becomes available after completion)

#### Scenario: Instructions JSON output

- **WHEN** user runs `openspec instructions <artifact> --change <id> --json`
- **THEN** the system outputs JSON matching ArtifactInstructions interface

#### Scenario: Unknown artifact

- **WHEN** user runs `openspec instructions unknown-artifact --change <id>`
- **THEN** the system displays an error listing valid artifact IDs for the schema

#### Scenario: Artifact with unmet dependencies

- **WHEN** user requests instructions for a blocked artifact
- **THEN** the system displays instructions with a warning about missing dependencies

#### Scenario: Instructions on scaffolded change

- **WHEN** user runs `openspec instructions proposal --change <id>` on a scaffolded change
- **THEN** system outputs template and metadata for creating the proposal
- **AND** does not require any artifacts to already exist
