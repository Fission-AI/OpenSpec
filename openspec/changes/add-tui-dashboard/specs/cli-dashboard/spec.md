# CLI Dashboard Specification

## Purpose

The dashboard command SHALL provide an interactive Terminal User Interface (TUI) for real-time visualization and management of OpenSpec specifications and changes, enabling developers to monitor, explore, and interact with their spec-driven development workflow through a unified interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Dashboard Launch Command

The system SHALL provide a `dashboard` command that launches an interactive TUI for managing specs and changes.

  - Deltas (added/modified/removed counts)
  - Tasks (completed/total)
  - Status (pending/in-progress/ready)
  - Created (date)

#### Scenario: Task progress visualization

- **WHEN** a change has tasks
- **THEN** display a progress bar showing completion
- **AND** use color coding:
  - Green for completed tasks
  - Yellow for in-progress
  - Gray for pending

### Requirement: Diff Viewer

The dashboard SHALL provide side-by-side diff visualization for comparing specs with proposed changes.

#### Scenario: Viewing diffs

- **WHEN** selecting a change and pressing 'd'
- **THEN** display a split-pane view:
  - Left pane: Current spec
  - Right pane: Proposed spec with changes
  - Highlighted differences with color coding

#### Scenario: Navigating diffs

- **WHEN** viewing diffs
- **THEN** provide navigation:
  - 'n' for next difference
  - 'p' for previous difference
  - 'q' to return to main view
  - Mouse scroll support if available

### Requirement: Real-time Updates

The dashboard SHALL monitor file system changes and update displays automatically.

#### Scenario: Detecting spec changes

- **WHEN** a spec file is modified
- **THEN** the dashboard SHALL:
  - Update the affected spec's last modified time
  - Re-run validation if auto-validate is enabled
  - Flash the updated row briefly
  - Update statistics in the header

#### Scenario: Detecting new changes

- **WHEN** a new change directory is created
- **THEN** automatically add it to the Changes view
- **AND** display a notification in the status bar

### Requirement: Quick Actions Menu

The dashboard SHALL provide keyboard shortcuts for common operations.

#### Scenario: Global shortcuts

- **WHEN** the dashboard is active
- **THEN** these shortcuts SHALL be available:
  - 'q' or 'Ctrl+C': Quit dashboard
  - 'Tab': Switch between tabs
  - '?': Show help overlay
  - '/': Activate search
  - 'r': Refresh all data
  - 'a': Archive selected change

#### Scenario: Context-sensitive shortcuts

- **WHEN** an item is selected
- **THEN** additional shortcuts become available:
  - 'Enter': Show details
  - 'v': Validate
  - 'd': Show diff
  - 'e': Open in editor (if configured)

### Requirement: Search and Filter

The dashboard SHALL provide search functionality across specs and changes.

#### Scenario: Searching items

- **WHEN** pressing '/' key
- **THEN** activate search mode
- **AND** filter displayed items as user types
- **AND** highlight matching text
- **AND** show match count in status bar

#### Scenario: Filter options

- **WHEN** in search mode
- **THEN** support filter prefixes:
  - 'spec:' to search only specs
  - 'change:' to search only changes
  - 'status:' to filter by status
  - Regular text searches all fields

### Requirement: Validation Dashboard

The dashboard SHALL provide a dedicated view for validation status across all specs and changes.

#### Scenario: Validation overview

- **WHEN** pressing 'V' (capital V)
