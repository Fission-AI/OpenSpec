# Add Spec Conflict Handling

## Why

Multiple changes modifying the same spec create conflicts when both contain future state specs, making parallel development difficult and forcing unnecessary serialization of work.

## What Changes

- Add conflict detection between pending changes
- Introduce base spec tracking for each change
- Add merge strategy documentation
- Create tooling to identify and resolve spec conflicts
- Update OpenSpec conventions to handle concurrent modifications

## Impact

- Affected specs: openspec conventions and workflow
- Affected code: New conflict detection tooling, updated change creation process
- Breaking changes: None - additive functionality only
