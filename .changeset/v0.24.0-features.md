### New Features

- **Onboarding skill** — New `opsx:onboard` skill provides guided walkthrough for your first complete OpenSpec workflow cycle
- **Multi-provider skill generation** — Use `--tool` flag with `artifact-experimental-setup` to generate skills for Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, and 18 other AI tools
- **Interactive tool selection** — Run `artifact-experimental-setup` without `--tool` flag to get a searchable multi-select UI for choosing AI tools
- **Merged init and experimental commands** — Single unified setup experience with automatic legacy artifact detection and cleanup
- **Agent Skills metadata** — Skill templates now include license, compatibility, and metadata fields per Agent Skills specification

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed Claude Code slash command parsing issue where colons in names caused fallback to incorrect descriptions
- Fixed task file parsing to handle trailing whitespace in task lines
- Fixed JSON instruction output to separate context and rules from template, preventing AI assistants from copying constraint blocks into artifacts

### Other

- Comprehensive documentation overhaul with new getting-started guide, workflow patterns, and customization documentation
