"@fission-ai/openspec": minor

### New Features

- **Feedback command** — Submit feedback directly from the CLI with `openspec feedback`, which creates GitHub Issues with automatic metadata inclusion and graceful fallback for manual submission
- **Nix flake support** — Install and develop openspec using Nix with the new `flake.nix`, including automated flake maintenance and CI validation

### Bug Fixes

- **Explore mode guardrails** — Explore mode now explicitly prevents implementation, keeping the focus on thinking and discovery while still allowing artifact creation

### Other

- Improved change inference in `opsx apply` — automatically detects the target change from conversation context or prompts when ambiguous
- Streamlined archive sync assessment with clearer delta spec location guidance
