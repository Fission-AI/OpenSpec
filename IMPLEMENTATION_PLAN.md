# Rust Port Implementation Plan

## Overview
This implementation plan outlines the necessary steps to achieve a complete Rust port of the OpenSpec project. The plan prioritizes maintaining the essence of the original implementation while taking advantage of Rust's features and safety guarantees.

## Exclusions
- **Telemetry**: The telemetry functionalities will be omitted in this implementation phase.
- **Shell Completion Commands**: Any shell completion command features will not be included in this initial phase.

## Core Commands
The implementation will focus on the following 10 core commands:
1. Command 1: Description
2. Command 2: Description
3. Command 3: Description
4. Command 4: Description
5. Command 5: Description
6. Command 6: Description
7. Command 7: Description
8. Command 8: Description
9. Command 9: Description
10. Command 10: Description

## Development Approach
The project will adopt a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach, ensuring that tests are written before the actual implementation of features. This will help maintain code quality and reduce bugs.

## Timeline
The implementation plan is structured around an 8-week timeline as follows:
- **Week 1**: Requirements gathering and finalizing core commands.
- **Week 2**: Setting up the Rust environment and initial architecture.
- **Week 3-5**: Implementing core commands with TDD.
- **Week 6**: Integration testing and refinements.
- **Week 7**: Documentation and final adjustments.
- **Week 8**: Code review and final testing.

## Architectural Decisions
- **Data Handling**: Description of how data will be managed and represented.
- **Error Management**: Approach to error handling in Rust.
- **Concurrency Model**: Details about how concurrency will be managed (if applicable).

This plan is subject to changes based on ongoing feedback and technical challenges encountered during implementation.
